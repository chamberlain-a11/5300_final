Theoretical Mechanics Final Homework

## Double (and more) Pendulum
nPendulum.ipyb
solves the euler-lagrange equations for an n-Pendulum given a arrays of mass and length (gravitational acceleration can be tuned optionally) and initial conditions for the angles and their initial rates of change

## Gravitational orbits in Cartesian Coordinates
TBP.ipyb
solves the euler-lagrange equations for two bodies under gravitational attraction in inertial coordinates and plots the results in the both the inertial and rest frames
